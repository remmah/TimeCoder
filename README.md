# TimeCoder

TimeCoder is a stopwatch with basic logging functionality. When you press the space bar or the "Log Current Timestamp" button, the app will append the currently elapsed time to a list of timestamps directly below the stopwatch. 

An example use case: When I am recording video, I use TimeCoder to mark points in the recording that I want to refer to during editing and post-production.

**Please note:** This app does not currently have data persistence, so if you refresh the tab, you'll lose the stopwatch time and your list of timestamps. When I need to save a list of timestamps, I usually just take a screenshot of the list.

## Using the app

If you're not interested in the code and just want to use the app, [head here](https://remmah.github.io/TimeCoder/) You can also download a pre-built version of the app from the [Releases](https://github.com/remmah/TimeCoder/releases) tab to use locally. There will also be a pre-built version available through itch.io in the future.
