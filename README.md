# TimeCoder

TimeCoder is a stopwatch with basic logging functionality. When you press the space bar or the "Log Current Timestamp" button, the app will append the currently elapsed time to a list of timestamps directly below the stopwatch. 

An example use case: When I am recording video, I use TimeCoder to mark points in the recording that I want to refer to during editing and post-production.

## Using the pre-built version
